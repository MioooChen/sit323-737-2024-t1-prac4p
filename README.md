Set up the development environment:
Make sure you have Node.js installed
Create a new Node.js project

Install Express framework:
Run the command npm install express in the terminal to install the Express framework

Design API endpoint:
Create a new file app.js in your project, this will contain your service logic
In the app.js file, import Express and set up a basic server


Implement API endpoints and error handling:
In each endpoint, add logic to receive the input parameters (num1 and num2), perform the corresponding arithmetic operation, and return the result
Make sure the input is validated and return an error response if num1 or num2 is not a valid number

Run and test the microservice:
Run the command node app.js in the terminal to start your service
Use the Postman testing tool to test your API endpoints to ensure they perform arithmetic operations correctly and return appropriate error messages in error cases
